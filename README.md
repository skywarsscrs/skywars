- **Kill Aura (Most Advanced Edition)** ⚔️  
  Automatically detects and attacks nearby enemies within a customizable radius (default 12-18 studs). Includes smooth rotation, perfect hit detection, team-check bypass, and adjustable strength levels so you never miss a single opponent. Works flawlessly in crowded mid-fight scenarios and 1v1 duels alike.

- **Auto Clicker (Ultra Fast CPS)** 🖱️  
  Reaches insane clicks-per-second rates without detection risks on most servers. Features humanized randomization, customizable CPS range (8-25+), and toggleable modes for sword fights, bow spamming, or block placement. Perfect when combined with **skywars script auto click** mode during intense bridge rushes.

- **Auto Farm (Resource & Coin Generator)** 💰  
  Intelligently collects floating coins, ores, and chests across the map while staying semi-safe. Includes pathfinding to high-value spots, auto-equip best tools, and smart inventory management so you always have the best gear. Great for passive grinding between matches or when waiting for the next round.

- **Fly (Smooth & Undetectable)** 🕊️  
  Full 3-axis flight control with speed adjustment (1x to 10x normal speed), no-clip toggle, and vertical/horizontal stabilizers. Includes anti-fall damage and auto-leveling for those clutch skybridge escapes.

- **Speed & Bunny Hop** 🏃‍♂️  
  Boosts your movement speed up to 5x while maintaining natural-looking animations. Bunny hop module adds perfect momentum preservation and automatic jumping patterns for insane mobility across islands.

- **ESP (Player & Item Highlight)** 👀  
  Wallhack-style boxes around players, name tags with health/distance, loot ESP showing diamond/legendary items, and chest tracers. Color-coded by team and threat level so you always know who's dangerous.

- **Auto Bridge / Scaffold** 🧱  
  Places blocks underneath you instantly as you walk forward. Supports multiple materials, diagonal bridging, god-bridge patterns, and speed bridging modes. Never fall off again!

- **Infinite Jump & No Fall Damage** ⬆️  
  Jump as many times as you want in mid-air and land from any height without taking damage. Essential for sky island hopping and clutch plays.

- **Reach & Hitbox Expander** 📏  
  Extends your attack range by up to 15 extra studs. Adjustable hitbox size multiplier for easier hits even when enemies are dodging.

- **Anti-Knockback & Velocity Control** 🛡️  
  Reduces or completely nullifies knockback from TNT, knockback swords, and explosions. Stay exactly where you want during fights.

- **Auto Tool Selector & Inventory Manager** 🗃️  
  Automatically switches to the best weapon/tool based on situation (sword for close combat, bow for range, blocks for bridging). Smart inventory sorting keeps your hotbar optimized.

All these features are toggleable via a beautiful, modern GUI that appears when you inject the script. No complicated menus — everything is one-click away! 🎛️
